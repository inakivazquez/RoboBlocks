# RoboBlocks
This a repository of a Unity ML-Agents project. It was developed under Unity 2019.3.5f1 with ML-Agents 0.14.1.</br></br>
The goal of the project was training different robots to perform taks consisting in collecting blocks around an area and droping them in a target zone.</br></br>
The basic dynamics was based on the <a href="https://connect.unity.com/p/ml-agents-penguins-unity-learn">Penguins project</a>, although I preferred better <a href="https://www.immersivelimit.com/tutorials/unity-ml-agents-penguins">this other approach by Immersive Limit</a>, including the use of Curriculum Learning in any case.</br></br>
Sample video of the result can be found here:</br></br>
